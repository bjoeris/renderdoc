###Introduction




PySide is the [Python Qt bindings project](http://wiki.qt.io/PySide2), providing access the complete Qt 5.x framework
as well as to generator tools for rapidly generating bindings for any C++ libraries.

The PySide project is developed in the open, with all facilities you'd expect
from any modern OSS project such as all code in a git repository and an open design process. We welcome
any contribution conforming to the [Qt Contribution Agreement](https://www.qt.io/contributionagreement/).


PySide 2 supports Qt5. For building, please read about [getting the dependencies](https://github.com/PySide/pyside2/wiki/Dependencies). Then download the sources by running `git clone --recursive https://code.qt.io/pyside/pyside-setup`.
